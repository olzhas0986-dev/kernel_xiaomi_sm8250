	 *         over a scheduling period, since it is assumed to be
	 *         constant during that interval.
	 *
	 * By injecting (1) in (2), 'cpu_nrg' can be re-expressed as a product

	 * as 'cs->cost'.

	 * Since all CPUs of the domain have the same micro-architecture, they
	 * share the same 'cs->cost', and the same CPU capacity. Hence, the
